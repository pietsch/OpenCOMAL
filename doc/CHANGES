0.2.0:
	- First free release of OpenComal

0.2.1:
	- Various small bugs
	- Compatibility with BSD/OS 4.3 (thanks: Kurt. J. Lidl)

0.2.2:
	- The ENV command has been added (various impacts on memory mgmt etc).
	- Bug: Segfault when WRITE-ing unassigned elements of a string array
	- Bug: Forgot to set scan_ok=0 after a LOAD
	- Bug: mem_free called free instead of sys_free
	- Bug: Someone called free instead of mem_free
	- Small syntax error in pdcpars.y fixed (thanks: Thierry B.)
	  (was caught by newer and less forgiving bison 1.35)

0.2.3:
	- Uhhh, not much, but 0.2.2 was never released due to a CVS tagging
	  mistake...

0.2.4:
	- "Official" MsDos & Win32 support
	- Changed the format of the SAVE file to include a marker and
	  the HOST_OS_CODE of the OS the file was created with

0.2.5:
	- Patched my development system so the precompiled binaries for Linux
	  no longer have a depedency on libtinfo.so.5
	- Added SYS(sbrk) to the Linux code (returns the current end 
          address of the interpreter's data segment).
	- Fixed small error in interpreting variable argument list in
	  pars_error (pdcparss.c).
	- Lexical analysis error "Unexpected character" now gives hex
	  code of the unexpected character.
	- Fixed error when pressing ^C during editing an errounous
	  ENTERed line.
	- Fixed editing of ENTERed lines in error (at least under Linux).
	- Fixed various errors related to ENTERing files in MsDos format
	  under Linux (CRLF issues)...
	- Added BYE as an alias for QUIT
	- Allowed for the IMPORT of PROCs and FUNCs. This is not
	  necessary in OpenComal (the IMPORT), but it was in UniComal.
	  OpenComal allows for the IMPORT, but it is a NOP. Upon first
	  execution, a warning is given...
	* pre2:
	- Added the DIR, DIR$, UNIT and UNIT$ statements and functions.
	  (this also lead to changes in the internal symbols, and hence
	  in changes in the SAVE file format).
	- Solved error in comparing parameter lists of externally
	  defined procedures/functions with the stub in the main
	  program.
	- Comments appeared in the code! Has somebody gone mad? :-)
	* pre3:
	- Made it possible to use "" inside a string to denote a single
	  "; e.g. print """OpenComal"" rulez!"
	- Added != as a token identical to <> (neqSYM)
	  This to make it easier for C/C++/Java hackers like me to use
	  Comal :-)
	- I hacked away extensively at the array handling code. An array
	  is now a valid rvalue, so the following is now possible:
	  	a$()=b$()
	  The () brackets are necessary if the array is an rvalue, and
	  not when it's an lvalue.
	  When confronted with an array rvalue that it does not know
	  (unDIMmed array), the interpreter tries to execute it as a
	  function call.
	* pre4:
	- Changed the way floating point constants are being maintained
	  in the expressions parse trees. Now both the text and the
	  binary values are maintained. This makes it possible to LIST
	  the program exactly as the user typed it, regardless of internal
	  inaccuracies in binary floating point systems.
	  But, the SAVE file format changed again because of this :-(
	- Added SYS(now) under Linux; gives the number of seconds sinds 
	  the epoch (1-1-1970)
	- Added the SPC$ function
	- Added SYS$(version); gives the version of the OpenComal 
	  interpreter
	- I plugged GNU ReadLine into the Linux version. This makes 
	  editing lines much friendlier. The history mechanism is 
	  supported too (there's still a small error in editing a large 
	  line (larger>width) on the bottom line of the window...).
	* pre5:
	- Solved a problem with the DIR command on Win32 and MsDos; 
	  dir "*.obj" gave a "Bad command or filename" due to an error
	  in creating the operating system command (sys_dir()).
	- Solved a bug in MsDos OpenComal where calling an operating system
	  command had no effect on the cursor position, even when the
	  called command produced text output. The cursor command is now 
	  being reread after an OS command.
	- Solved a bug in LISTing string constants that contained a \. The
	  backslash was not properly escaped...
	- Added PASS as an alias for OS
	- Added KEY$ and INKEY$
	- Added CHDIR, MKDIR and RMDIR
	* final
	- Solved a problem with READ type mismatches (e.g. READ a with 
	  the current DATA expression a string).

0.2.6:
	- New sys_edit() for Win32 by Gary Lake.
	- Modified REF implementation so that array element can be a REF
	  parameter
	- Removed irritating bug in allocating new floating point exp
	  element memory that messed up the memory (GETEXP(double) in
	  pars_exp_float).
	- Solved signedness problem in characters > 127
	  (e.g. print ord(chr$(129)) now prints 129 as expected)
	- Now allowed for substring specification like
	  a$(:n#:). This resulted in changes to the SAVE format that I
	  think are upward compatible from previous releases.
	- There now exists a one line version of REPEAT:
	       100 REPEAT a$:+"x" UNTIL LEN(A$)=20
	  This changed the SAVE format (again... :-/ )
	- Added UPPER$(<stringexp>) and LOWER$(<stringexp>)
	* Declared 0.2.6-pre1
	- Overhauled the RND function. Now does:
	  RND 
	  RND(10)
	  RND(-10,10)
	* Declared 0.2.6-pre2
	- Added RETRY (in HANDLER part of ENDTRAP). This lead to the
	  first "goto" statement in the OpenComal source! :-)
	  And, guess what, the SAVE format changed because of adding a
	  new keyword...  :-(
	- Added FRAC and ROUND.
